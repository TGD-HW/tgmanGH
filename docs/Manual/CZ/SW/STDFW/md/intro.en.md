This manual describes the setup of the TGZ drive in the EtherCAT network. The TGZ drives must be programmed with the corresponding firmware.
The [TGZ HW user's manual](../../../../CZ/TGZ/TGZ-D-48-13_26/md/mark.md) must be thoroughly read and used before the drive can be used in the EtherCAT environment.
