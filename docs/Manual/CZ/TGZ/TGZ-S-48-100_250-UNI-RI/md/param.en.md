!!! info "Static brake power"

	\* Without power supply for the servomotor static brake (from 0.5 to 1A for the TGN series) and digital outputs (up to 6 x 300 mA).
	
!!! info "Cooling"

	To load the servo amplifier with a rated current of - 100 A it is necessary to install a heat sink (mounting plate).
	The recommended material is aluminium with minimum area of S = 9 dm<sup>2</sup>.
	The minimum thickness of the heat sink is 2 mm.
	The operating time is limited when higher currents are applied (250 A = 3 s).
	For other currents between 100 A and 250 A, you can check the maximum operating time of the servo amplifier with the manufacturer.
