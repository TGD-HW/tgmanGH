	!!! warning "USB power"	
	
		Although this is an auxiliary power supply, it is strongly recommended to connect it. 
		The device can be powered solely through the X2 - USB connector directly from the TGMmini; however, this unnecessarily loads its internal power supply.
		When using additional external USB devices connected to the TGMmini, powering the display via the X1 (24VDC) connector is mandatory!

	Mandatory connection to the standard HDMI type A X7 connector of the [TGMmini](../../TGMmini/md/connectors.md#TGMmini_IOside) device to enable the display.
	Due to EMI resistance, please use the shortest possible length of HDMI cable necessary. The use of flat HDMI cables is not recommended.
