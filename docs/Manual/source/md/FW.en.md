##Introduction
Updating the firmware (FW) of the TGZ servo amplifier is typically done using the TGZ GUI software.
It is necessary to select the appropriate firmware based on the specific type of servo amplifier.
The firmware file has the *.TGZFW extension.

##Possible Combinations
FW is categorized as follows:

1)	By the type of control board. The older version produced until around 2017 is referred to as "version 4." This type is still available for special applications. 
The newer type "version 5" is the standard production and the most widely used version.
	
2)	By the number of controlled drive axes.
S - Single. This refers to the single-axis version of the servo amplifier.
D - Double. This refers to the dual-axis version of the servo amplifier.

3)	By the type of control communication. Variants available include EtherCAT, Profinet, or CoE + CANOpen.

4)	By the type of position sensor (feedback). Available options include standard Hiperface DSL, Endat 2.2, or BISS-C.
