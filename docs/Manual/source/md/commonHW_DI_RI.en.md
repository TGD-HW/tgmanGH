##Basic description {#commonDI1-8_RI}
The TGZ servo amplifier has eight galvanically isolated fast digital inputs integrated on the **X8** connector in the ruggedized (RI) version.
All of them are standard, passive, with a nominal input level of +24V.
All digital inputs DI 1-8 have built-in reverse polarity protection (down to -70V) and overvoltage protection (above 30V).
